# CSE 12 Winter 2023 PA4 - Iterators

**Due date: Thursday, February 16 @ 11:59 PM PDT**

[There is an FAQ post on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lch5pcfyhil3n8/post/415).  Please read that post first if you have any questions.


### **Learning goals**

* Implement a data structure similar to Java’s Iterator with generic types
* Write JUnit tests to verify proper implementation

## Testing and Implementation of ListIterator [100 points]

You will implement an iterator and write JUnit tests to ensure that your implementation functions correctly.

**Read the entire write-up before you start coding.**

Download the starter code from [here](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/cse12-wi23-pa4-Iterator-starter) and put it in a directory in your working environment. 

You will find the following files:

```
+-- PA4
|    +-- MyListIteratorCustomTester.java    Edit this file
|    +-- MyListIteratorPublicTester.java
```

**Copy over MyLinkedList.java from PA3 to this directory**, because you will also edit this file.


### Part 1: JUnit Testing (20 points)

We provide two test files:

* `MyListIteratorPublicTester.java`
    * This contains all the public test cases we will use to grade your MyListIterator implementation (visible on Gradescope).
* `MyListIteratorCustomTester.java`
    * Contains some of the headers and description to the hidden test cases we will use to grade your MyListIterator implementation (hidden until the PA is graded). ⚠️There are hidden tests on Gradescope not described in the write-up. Make sure to write additional tests to verify your implementation's correctness! ⚠️

Your task: Implement the missing unit tests in `MyListIteratorCustomTester.java` based on the description in the Tests table below.

* Your tests will be graded by checking if they pass on a good implementation and fail on a bad implementation. If a test fails on a good implementation, then the test is written incorrectly. If a test passes on a bad implementation, it may be written incorrectly or may be not be rigorous enough (try adding more asserts).
* Some of your tests will be run on several bad implementations. You will receive 2 pts for every bad implementation your test fails (if your test also passes on the good implementation).
* DO NOT CHANGE THE TEST HEADERS!

#### How to compile and run the testers:
Running the tester on UNIX based systems (including a mac):

* Compile: `javac -cp ../libs/junit-4.13.2.jar:../libs/hamcrest-2.2.jar:. MyListIteratorPublicTester.java`
* Execute: `java -cp ../libs/junit-4.13.2.jar:../libs/hamcrest-2.2.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MyListIteratorPublicTester`

Running the tester on Windows systems:

* Compile: `javac -cp ".;..\libs\junit-4.13.2.jar;..\libs\hamcrest-2.2.jar" MyListIteratorPublicTester.java`
* Execute: `java -cp ".;..\libs\junit-4.13.2.jar;..\libs\hamcrest-2.2.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MyListIteratorPublicTester`

You should run the above commands in the starter directory. To run the custom tester, replace references to MyListIteratorPublicTester with MyListIteratorCustomTester in the above commands.

⚠️Your code must first compile in order to receive credit for the different test cases. You will receive a zero if your code doesn’t compile.

### Part 2: Implementation of ListIterator (75 points)

#### Overview:

It is important to thoroughly test out your `MyLinkedList` implementation before working on this, as a buggy `MyLinkedList` implementation will give you a hard time testing your ListIterator. The resubmission assignment for PA3 is currently open and all test cases are be visible. 

You should also import `java.util.NoSuchElementException`, `java.util.ListIterator`, and `java.util.Iterator` apart from the imports you used in PA3.

Inside MyLinkedList.java, create a class named `MyListIterator` that implements the [`ListIterator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ListIterator.html) interface as an inner class (contained inside the definition of the `MyLinkedList` class). This is the approach you should use to create your `MyListIterator`.

``` java
public class MyLinkedList<E> extends AbstractList<E> {
    // class variables

    // Node inner class

    // MyLinkedList methods

    protected class MyListIterator implements ListIterator<E> {

        // class variables here

        // MyListIterator methods
        public boolean hasNext() {
            // your code here
        }
        // more methods, etc.
    }
}
```

The `MyListIterator` is able to traverse the list by moving a space at a time in either direction. The `MyListIterator` can also add, set, and remove elements in the list. However, unlike the add, set, and remove implemented in PA3 for `MyLinkedList` that can directly use a specific index, the `MyListIterator` must first move positions (using next and previous) to modify the desired index in add, set, and remove.


#### **Implementation:**

* Your methods should properly throw `IllegalStateException`, `NoSuchElementException`, and `NullPointerException` exceptions. This means you DO NOT HAVE TO IMPLEMENT throwing ALL exceptions as the official Javadoc would indicate. Please refer to the table below. Note that our test cases do not check for the exception message, just that the correct exception was thrown. 
* You should use the getters and setters defined in the Node class to access and modify Node objects.  Do not modify or access the Node’s member variables directly.
* Do not use MyLinkedList methods to write iterator methods. If you use a MyLinkedList method in an iterator method, you will get a 0 for that method. We will use our MyLinkedList class when running test cases for MyListIterator, and it will throw an exception if a MyLinkedList method is used. However, feel free to use the Node methods.
* Do not define any helper methods in the MyLinkedList class. If you have helper methods, they should go in the inner class MyListIterator.
* DO NOT import and use Java’s built-in LinkedList. **If we see that you _import java.util.LinkedList;_ you will not receive any credit! ⚠️**
* Do not make any instance variables private, they should have the default access modifier.
* You may add private static final variables to be used as constants, but do not add any other instance variables and do not add any static variables.

#### **Public methods to add to MyLinkedList.java**

Once you are sure your iterator is working, you should add and implement the following methods in MyLinkedList to override the AbstractList implementations. Each of these should just create a new `MyListIterator` and return it.

``` java
public ListIterator<E> listIterator() {
    return new MyListIterator();
}

public Iterator<E> iterator() {
    return new MyListIterator();
}
```

Examples for the MyListIterator Methods can be found in the [Appendix](#Appendix).


### Part 3: Coding Style (5 points)

Coding style is an important part of ensuring readability and maintainability of your code. We will grade your code style in all submitted code files according to the style guidelines. Namely, there are a few things you must have in each file/class/method:

* File header
* Class header
* Method header(s)
* Inline comments
* Proper indentation
* Descriptive variable names
* No magic numbers (Exception: Magic numbers can be used for testing.)
* Reasonably short methods (if you have implemented each method according to the specification in this write-up, you’re fine). This is not enforced as strictly.
* Lines shorter than 80 characters
* Javadoc conventions (`@param`, `@return` tags, `/** comments */`, etc.)


A full style guide can be found [here](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/style-guide/blob/main/README.md) and a sample styled file can be found [here](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/style-guide/blob/main/SampleFile.java). If you need any clarifications, feel free to ask on Piazza.


## Submission Instructions

#### Turning in your code

* Submit all of the following files to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/481483/assignments) by Thursday, February 16, 2023, 11:59pm PST. 
    * `MyLinkedList.java`
    * `MyListIteratorCustomTester.java`

**Important**: Even if your code does not pass all the tests, you will still be able to submit your homework to receive partial points for the tests that you passed. Make sure your code compiles in order to receive partial credit.

#### How your assignment will be evaluated [100 points]

* **Correctness** [95 points] You will earn points based on the autograder tests that your code passes. If the autograder tests are not able to run (e.g., your code does not compile or it does not match the specifications in this writeup), you may not earn credit.
    * Tester [20 points]
        * The autograder will test your implementation of the Junit tests. Your unit tests are expected to fail or pass based on the [Part 1 Test Table](#Tests-Table-List-of-test-cases-to-write-and-their-description).
    * MyListIterator [75 points]
        * The autograder will test your implementation of MyListIterator on the public test cases given in `MyListIteratorPublicTester.java` and hidden test cases not described in this PA writeup.
* **Coding Style** [5 points]
    * `MyLinkedList.java` will be graded on style. `MyListIteratorCustomTester.java` will only be graded on file header.
    
## Appendix

### **Example for MyListIterator Methods**

It might be helpful to consider that the iterator has (size+1) positions in the list: just after the sentinel head node (i.e. just before the first node containing data), between the 0 and 1 index, ..., just before the sentinel tail node (i.e., just after the last node containing data).

As seen in the figure below, the iterator has 4 positions when the size of the MyLinkedList is 3. Green numbers indicate the indices for MyLinkedList, while blue numbers indicate the indices for MyListIterator.

Suppose we already have a MyLinkedList with 3 nodes:  \
`head <-> c <-> s <-> e <-> tail`

**MyListIterator should look like this after initialization:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/yk221Kz.png)

After calling the constructor, `idx` should be 0, `forward` can be true or false (here we set it to true), `canRemoveOrSet` should be false, `left` should be pointing to the sentinel head node, and `right` should be pointing to the sentinel head node’s next node.

**After calling `next()`:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/voY82cZ.png)

“c” should be returned. Since we just called `next()`, `canRemoveOrSet` is set to `true `and `forward` is set to `true`.

**After calling `add("a")`:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/8jDBwYJ.png)

`MyLinkedList` `size` as well as `MyListIterator` `idx` increments, `canRemoveOrSet` changes to `false`. \
If `next()` is called now, “s” should be returned. If `remove()` is called now, an `IllegalStateException` should be thrown since `canRemoveOrSet` is `false`.

**After calling `previous()`:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/H1ARXSB.png)

“a” is returned by the iterator. `forward` is set to `false` since the iterator is going in the reverse direction now. `idx` decrements, `canRemoveOrSet` is again `true`.

**After calling `remove()`:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/TmQKhDl.png)

`MyLinkedList` `size` decrements. “a” is removed from the linked list. `canRemoveOrSet` is set to `false`.
